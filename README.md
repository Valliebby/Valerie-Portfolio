# Valerie-Portfolio

// Hello my Name is Valerie Elizabeth Guerra, I am a web developer in Austin Texas and this is a 
portfolio website I created to showcase my accomplishments skills and talents to employers. 
I hope you enjoy!

I first started with the basic building blocks of HTML and added a home, about me link, and 
my name using a nav bar. Then I created twelve more folders using a grid layout to connect
a link for each of my portfolio topics. I also added images, titles, descriptions, and content
to each section. I then created a CSS folder to develope some styling and functions to HTML.
Then towards the end of finishing I used javascript to connect files and functions with
CSS and HTML.

Thank you for visiting My Portfolio Webpage!
