Features
Home: An introduction to myself and a brief overview of my skills and experience.
Projects: A showcase of my latest and notable projects with descriptions and links to their respective GitHub repositories or live demos.
Skills: An overview of the programming languages, frameworks, and technologies I am proficient in.
Contact: A contact form where users can reach out to me for collaboration or job opportunities.

I first started with the basic building blocks of HTML and added a home, about me link, and 
my name using a nav bar. Then I created twelve more folders using a grid layout to connect
a link for each of my portfolio topics. I then created a CSS folder to develope some styling and functions to HTML.
Then towards the end of finishing I used javascript to connect files and functions with
CSS and HTML.
