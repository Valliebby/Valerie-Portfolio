            <h1>Hi, Thanks for Visiting My Site. </h1>

             <p>Hello my Name is Valerie Elizabeth Guerra, I am a web developer in Austin TX. I have been working with computer graphics and deign for about 
             15 years now and have a career in Graphic design since 2014. I've always had an interest for coding and Software engineering and decided to 
             further my education and career in one of the fastest growing industries today. Since then I have accomplished so many new challenges I never 
             thought I could achieve. I strive to be the best and learn something new everyday from colleagues and other developers I've collaborated with
             in past workmanship. I have also created many websites and applications for several different industries and companies over the years
             that were very successful.   
            </p>
