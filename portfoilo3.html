          <h1>Translating designs and wireframes into high quality code.</h1>

          <p> In translating designs and wireframes into high quality code I Develop technologies to maintain our market leadership 
          using the latest tools and frameworks. Write software in accordance with requirements and specifications and use best practices 
          to build in high-quality. Debug and validate software issues on the latest and greatest unreleased products as well as those encountered 
          by customers. I write automated unit tests and system level tests to continue building our automation pipeline and a release-ready product.
          In helping the scrum team to continuously improve its environment and processes we manged to stay on top of new technologies and look for ways 
          to apply it. We take time to ask questions and define the problem. You make learning a priority and a goal. You engage in collaborative planning 
          and constantly look to improve my team and deliver results. I always invest in my workspace to ensure they I have the marketplace knowledge, skills, 
          and competencies to bring this purpose to life while competing and leading in a global economy.
