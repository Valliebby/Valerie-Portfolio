            <h1>A Expert in the Agile Approach.</h1>

             <p> Very experience in Agile approach. Iterative or agile project management focuses on delivering maximum 
               value against business priorities in the time and budget allowed, especially when the drive to deliver is greater 
               than the risk. When approaching agile project management for the first time, it becomes apparent that there are 
               various trains of thought. The project breaks a requirement into smaller pieces, which are then prioritised by 
               the team in terms of importance. The Agile approach also promotes collaborative working, especially with the 
               customer. The agile project reflects, learns and adjusts at regular intervals to ensure that the customer is 
               always satisfied and is provided with outcomes that result in benefits. The Agile methods integrate planning 
               with execution, allowing an organisation to create a working mindset that helps a team respond effectively to 
               changing requirements.
